rddt - a Safari extension for reddit.com
========================================

This extension was born from these ideas:

* I like [reddit](http://reddit.com)
* I hate toolbars and extra chrome in my browser
* [Safari](http://apple.com/safari) has the best browsing experience
  * (Don't believe me? Safari 5 + Reader is the best way to read the internet)

Hence, an extension for Safari that adds a little "HUD" style overlay
providing a tiny bit of context for what the fine folks at reddit.com may
think of the particular page you are viewing.

If it appears as though no one has submitted the page yet, it conveniently
becomes a link to reddit.com's submission page.
